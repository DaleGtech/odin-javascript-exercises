Important info on js file

##I came up with code that seemed correct to me and passed all the tests in the spec.js file. However, when i asked chatGPT to compare and explain how my new and previous code both achieve the same thing, it told me it was incorrect. this is the explanation it gave. which does make sense now:

Original Code:

const removeFromArray = function(num1, ...arg) {
    let newArray = []; // Initialize an empty array to store the result
    for (let i = 0; i <= arg; i++) { // Loop method (incorrectly implemented)
        newArray += num1; // Append num1 to newArray (incorrect logic)
    }
    return newArray; // Return the new array
};

Why the Original Code Is Problematic:
Logical Errors:

Loop Condition: for (let i = 0; i <= arg; i++) { is logically incorrect. arg is an array, so comparing i to arg does not make sense. Normally, you'd loop over num1 to access each element of the original array.
Incorrect Operation on newArray: The line newArray += num1; is attempting to concatenate num1 as a string to newArray. This does not create an array but instead produces a single string, which is not the intended outcome.
Accidental Success:

Despite the logical issues, it's possible that the code accidentally worked because JavaScript may have coerced the operations in a way that coincidentally passed the tests. For instance, the newArray += num1 operation could result in string concatenation that might not immediately show errors in the context of the tests but could fail in more complex or different cases.

Revised (and Correct) Implementation:

const removeFromArray = function(num1, ...arg) {
    let newArray = []; // Initialize an empty array to store the result
    for (let i = 0; i < num1.length; i++) { // Loop through each element in 'num1'
        if (!arg.includes(num1[i])) { // Check if 'num1[i]' is not in 'arg'
            newArray.push(num1[i]); // Add the item to newArray if it's not in 'arg'
        }
    }
    return newArray; // Return the new array
};

Why This Revised Code Is Better:
Correct Looping Logic:

i < num1.length: The loop now correctly iterates over each element in the num1 array.
num1[i]: Accesses each element of the array during iteration, allowing the function to check if it should be removed.
Proper Array Manipulation:

arg.includes(num1[i]): This checks if the current element should be excluded.
newArray.push(num1[i]): Correctly adds only the elements that are not supposed to be removed.
Robust and Predictable:

This version is logically sound, easy to understand, and ensures that all edge cases are correctly handled, making the function more reliable and easier to maintain.
Conclusion:
While the original code may have passed the specific test cases provided, it contains logical flaws and bad practices that make it less reliable and harder to understand or extend. The revised code, on the other hand, is logically consistent, easier to understand, and better handles various cases and future changes.
